The game has 7 levels.
Each level is one planet with a custom color. You need to pick up the planet's energy sources around planets.
To pick energy source you need to fly through it. To visit/return a planet just fly to/into it.
When you pick up some energy source enemy is activated. 

You can use long press to share the game with your friends.  

Have a fun to play :)

<sub><sup>[Hint] There is one hidden hack to get immortality: you need to fly near the planet, but not fly into it. The torsion of the ship will begin and in this condition the enemy ship will not be able to hit you.</sup></sub>
